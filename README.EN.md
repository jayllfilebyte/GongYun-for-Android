## Introduction  

Welcome to the **GongYun** GitHub open-source page! This is a third-party academic management system designed for **Hubei University of Technology** students. It runs on the **Android** platform and supports a minimum version of **Android 8.0 (API level 26)**.  

This application is developed using the Jetpack Compose framework and written in Kotlin.  

During operation, the app **encrypts** and stores sensitive user data locally (such as student ID, password, enrollment year, and current academic year/semester). These details are only used for network requests and will not be used for other purposes.  

The reason for storing student ID and password is as follows: Even when selecting the "Remember Me" option while logging into the university's academic system, the returned session cookie expires just two hours after login. To prevent users from having to repeatedly enter their credentials after this period, the app stores them locally. If a network request fails due to an expired session, the app will automatically log in on behalf of the user.  

## Features  

Currently, the app offers the following functionalities:  

1. **Course-related**  
   - View class schedules for different academic years and weeks  
   - Home screen widget displaying the current day's schedule
